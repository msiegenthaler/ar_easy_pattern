AR Easy Pattern overlays a sewing pattern in the correct size over the camera image. Use it to draw to pattern onto the fabric without needing to print out and assemble the pattern on paper.

# Prepare
Download the anchor that is used to "home" the pattern and print in in color in A4 paper. The square has to be 15cm x 15cm, otherwise the pattern will not be in the correct size.

[Anchor.pdf](Assets/Anchor Cutout.pdf)

Then cut out the anchor along the dotted lines.

# Usage
- Put the anchor an the fabric and open the app
- Focus the square in the camera view, a small tutorial will appear
- load your sewing pattern (e.g. a A0 PDF) using the button in the bottom right. The PDF has to have the standard resolution of 72 dpi.
- adjust the relative position of the pattern using the arrow buttons on the screen
- while looking at your phone draw the outline and markings of the pattern
